# Hexdump Paper

Some printable note sheets for hand-drawn hexdumps.

Sometimes, nothing beats a pen and paper. I spend an awful lot of time staring
at memory and packed bit structures. I want to sketch it out on some note paper,
but then I have to manually write out all the byte offsets to understand what
I've just written! Lame!

These printable sheets should hopefully make that a lot easier - I can just keep
a small stack at my desk and when I need to draw out a structure, I've got
the template I need ready to go.

I've never used this before in anger, so the jury's still out on its usefulness,
but if you need something similar help yourself and tell me if you have any
great ideas for improvement.
